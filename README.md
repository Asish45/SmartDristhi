In this project we have used a deep learning model to track and estimate distance of objects from the camera(device) and give audio output to help and guide person's with an impaired vision.
The DistanceEstimation.py file tracks and gives audio output for the class of object detected and the distance from the camera.

Run the model using:
python DistanceEstimator.py
